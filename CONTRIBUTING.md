# Introduction

Thank you for your desire to contribute to the authorization service example.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

We are looking at this example as a robust way to build performant services to determine if a request has authorization to access a particular service or piece of data. Because of this we may not know all of the scenarios that folks run into - so you're contributions help us figure that out.

## Rules or Standards of Conduct

- Every PR must pass all of the checks
- Anything contributed must be cross platform
- The Authorization PolicyManager service should be as performant as possible
- There should be an SDK (Client project) for every API
- Be respectful when creating comments on issues or PRs
- Everything requires at least 1 reviewer when creating a PR to master
