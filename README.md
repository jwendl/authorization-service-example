## Introduction 

This is an Azure Function application that creates an authorization service which utilizes ABAC and PBAC principals to grant access to various microservices. 

The overall architecture includes APIM, Azure Functions, Azure SQL Database, Cosmos Database and Azure Active Directory components.

More information about each component exists as [PolicyManager](./src/Authorization/README.md), [CustomerData](./src/CustomerData/README.md) and [OrderData](./src/OrderData/README.md)
